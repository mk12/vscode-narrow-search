# VS Code Narrow Search

A simple VS Code extension that narrow searches.

This extension may be useful if you often find yourself editing the "files to include" field in the Search view.

## Install

```sh
npm install -g vsce
vsce package
code --install-extension *.vsix
```

## Commands

- **Narrow Search: Current Directory**: Narrows to the current file's directory
- **Narrow Search: Choose Preset**: Narrows to a preset filter

Narrowing the search directory also clears the search field. The VS Code Extension API does not provide a way out of this. However, you can easily retrieve the previous search by pressing the up arrow key.

## Configuration

Use `narrow-search.presets` to configure presets for the "Narrow Search: Choose Preset" command.
